      <p class="loctext">Today the Golden Gate Bridge is one the seven wonders of the modern world. This magnificent span, perhaps San Francisco’s most famous landmark, opened in 1937 after a four-year struggle against relentless winds, fog, rock and treacherous tides.

The 1.7 mile-long bridge is anchored by towers that reach 746 feet skyward and was once taller than any building in San Francisco! To support the suspended roadway, two cables—each more than 7,000 feet in length and containing 80,000 miles of wire—stretch over the top of the towers and are rooted in concrete anchorages on shore.

The Golden Gate Bridge brought the communities of San Francisco and Marin counties closer together and became one of the most driven sections of historic U.S. Route 101, which stretches from Los Angeles north to San Francisco and beyond. It’s equally popular with hikers and cyclists, and is the main attraction for runners partaking in any of our many local annual foot races.</p>
